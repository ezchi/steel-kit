Run all remaining stages in the Steel-Kit workflow automatically.

## Steps

0. Run `/clear` to clear the conversation context before starting this stage.

1. Read `.steel/state.json` to determine the current stage.

2. If `.steel/constitution.md` is still the placeholder template or missing, stop and tell the user to finish the constitution stage before any workflow stage can run.

3. If stage is `specification`, stop: tell the user to run `/steel-specify "<description>"` first.

4. Execute each remaining stage in order by following their slash command steps:
   - `clarification` → `/steel-clarify` steps
   - `planning` → `/steel-plan` steps
   - `task_breakdown` → `/steel-tasks` steps
   - `implementation` → `/steel-implement` steps
   - `validation` → `/steel-validate` steps
   - `retrospect` → `/steel-retrospect` steps

5. Between each stage, re-read `.steel/state.json` to confirm the stage advanced. If it didn't (e.g., human approval was declined at a gate), stop and inform the user.

6. After all stages complete (or stopped), run `/steel-status` to show final state.

Note: Human approval gates at specification→clarification and planning→task_breakdown will still pause and ask the user. If the user declines, the run stops at that stage.
